// There is issue with using certain buckets and singletone for wasm, the contract does not run on the secret

// if you go to scrt discord and search db_scan you will find the conversation I have pasted below:
//
// IIRC I think it fails because SecretNetwork doesn't implement db_scan
// And I think I was told that if it was implemented, all the keys you get with your key-value pairs from range would be encrypted anyway, but that was back during phase 2 testnet, so my memory might be off
// Assaf | SCRT Labs â€” 27/11/2020
// Yep we decided db_scan is very hard to implement in a secure way. We felt that the use case for it is thin at best and went ahead with the mainnet release.
// I'd recommend though to use bincode2 for storage serialization (more efficient) and serde_json_wasm for query result (better ux)
